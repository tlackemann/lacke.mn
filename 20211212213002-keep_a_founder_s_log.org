#+title: Keep a Founder's Log

/This article is a work in progress and is not yet finished./

I have been recently researching what it takes to run a small farm or homesteam lately. This has involved not only looking at properties but reading a lot of blogs and, more often than not, talking to real generational farmers who have spent their entire life out in the field.

Have you ever thought about what happens to a farm if the family decides to move on? Who takes it over and *how* do they take it over? What grows in the fields? When does it grow? How often does it grow? How many people does it take to harvest a field? What maintenance is required during the off-seasons? What work is involved pre-season? What tools or special equipment are required?

Farmers are incredibly smart and detailed people. Knowing one's land is crucial to surviving.
